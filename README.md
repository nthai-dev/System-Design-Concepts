## Client-Server Architecture
Almost every web application that you use is built on this simple yet powerful concept called client-server architecture.

![client-server]()
- The client requests to store, retrieve, or modify data.
- The server receives the request, processes it, performs the necessary operations, and sends back a response.
> This sounds simple, but thereâ€™s a big question: 
> How does the client even know where to find the server?

TL;DR:
> The client finds the server via DNS, config, or service discovery, and connects using an IP/port.
